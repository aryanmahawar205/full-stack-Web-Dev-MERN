## Introduction
HTML is a Markup Language. It's full form is Hyper Text Markup Language.
It is primarily used for structure and formatting of webpages. Formatting in the sense using bullet point, text in italics, etc.

## HTML Elements
Paragraphs, Heading and Images are the standard elements that a browser recognizes.
The components used to design the structure of websites are called HTML tags.

## HTML Tags
An HTML Tag is a container for some content or other tags.
It is surrounded angular brackets <>. Opening tags - <> and closing tags - </>
Eg. <p>This is a paragraph</p> where <p> is the opening paragraph tag, </p> is the closing paragraph tag and anything  between the opening and closing tags is the content of the tag. The whole thing altogether is called an HTML Element.

There are many tags in HTML such as:

1. Paragraph Tag (<p>Some Paragraph</p>)
2. Heading Tags (h1 to h6) - h1 being the largest font and h6 being the smallest.
